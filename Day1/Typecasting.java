//Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. They are as follows: First, all byte, short, and char values are promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands is double, the result is double.
